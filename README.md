## About
CultURIze is a four-step process to make persistent URI's for collection items, a spreadsheet to record persistent URI's, a desktop app to turn it in a .htaccess file, a Githubrepo to automate the configuration of an Apache webserver.

CultURIze is made for registrars, curator and managers of small to medium heritage collections. 

More information about the inspiration, governance, howto are on the [CultURIze Wiki](https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/CultURIze/wiki) 
  
## Getting Started
* Define the domain and numbering [scheme](https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/CultURIze/wiki/Define-a-Persistent-URI-Scheme) for your persistent URIs.
* Set up a [(Apache) webserver](https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/CultURIze/wiki/Set-Up-a-Webserver).
* Set up a [(Github) repository](https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/CultURIze/wiki/Set-Up-a-Code-Repository) and link it to your webserver.
* Record the persistent URIâ€™s in  a [spreadsheet](https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/CultURIze/wiki/Create-a-Spreadsheet). 
* Download and [install](https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/CultURIze/wiki/App-Installation-Instructions) the desktop application. Use it to turn your spreadsheet in an [server configuration file](App-Tutorial) and push it to your repository.
